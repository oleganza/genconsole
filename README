genconsole.rb helps to create an IRb console for your app or library in interactive mode.
It creates an executable (bin/console) and a module with helper methods (console.rb).
You are asked for paths and module name (default is Console).

This is a replacement for gem_console library (because i'm too lazy to bundle gem_console gem everywhere).
Also, this is a good example of a rare case when static code generation is better than a library.
